## 📌 Overview  
**Earth Guardian AI** is an innovative, AI-powered platform designed to **detect, monitor, and alert** about environmental risks such as:  
🔥 Wildfires  
🌫️ Air Pollution  
🌄 Terrain & Landslide Risks  

Built on **ISRO’s Problem Statement 14**, the system uses **multi-temporal LISS-4 satellite imagery** and real-time datasets (NASA FIRMS, OpenAQ, DEM) to identify changes and generate **early warnings** that save lives.

## 🚀 How It Works

- **1️⃣ User selects an Area of Interest (AOI)
- **2️⃣ System fetches satellite + real-time data
- **3️⃣ AI/ML models analyze risk levels
- **4️⃣ Risks are shown on a live dashboard
- **5️⃣ Users receive alerts + chatbot advice
